# Go LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in Go (Golang). It serves as a personal learning journey to improve my Go programming skills while solving algorithmic challenges.

## Purpose

- Practice and improve Go programming skills
- Document my learning journey
- Build a collection of algorithmic solutions
- Learn Go best practices and idioms

## Structure

Solutions are organized by problem categories (to be added as the repository grows):

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Dynamic Programming
- etc.

## Running the Solutions

Each solution can be run using:

```go
go run <filename>.go
```

## Testing

To run tests (if available):

```go
go test ./...
```

## Contributing
